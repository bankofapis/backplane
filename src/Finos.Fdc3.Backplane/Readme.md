## Backplane 

A desktop service which act as a message bus between multiple desktop agents for sending/receiving FDC3 compliant data.
It serves two purposes:

- Enables other desktop agents running in containers like openfin, finsemble to exchange message using bridge.
- Enables applications running outside container to exchange FDC3 compliant message using client libraries.

There are client libraries to this runtime which expose API enabling interoperability across consuming applications.
Currently available client libs:

- C#: Fdc3.Backplane.Client [details](../Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client/Readme.md)
- JS: @finos/fdc3-backplane-client [details](../Finos.Fdc3.Backplane.Client.JS/README.md)

## Supported Platforms
